Bank-Account
============

Week 3 project - This week the project consisted of writing a program with some kind of
character which can be tested and use git to put it onto Github. Then we needed
to create a HTML describing the project. 

For my project I made a bank account which allows the user to withdraw and make deposits.

The tests I did for this project included: the balance is given without doing
anything, the balance after a deposit is made, the balance after a withdrawal is
made, and the balance after a deposit and a withdrawal are made together. 

To run you need to have run_bank.rb and bank.rb files in the same directory and run run_bank.rb.
